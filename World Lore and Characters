“The Afflicted and the Faithful”
Some people in this world are born with a gene that marks them as the Afflicted. They suffer from mental disorders that torment their minds. But these disorders also grant them incredible powers that defy reality. They are the Afflicted.
But every power has a price. The more they use their gifts, the more they lose their sanity. They are haunted by illusions, moods, compulsions, fears, and pains that they cannot escape. They are also rejected and persecuted by the society that views them as abominations or threats. Some of them are pursued by the forces that want to use or destroy them. Others band together to defend themselves and fight for their freedom.
The power system of the Afflicted is based on a scale of disorders, from mild to severe. The more severe the disorder, the more potent and perilous the power. But the severity also affects the user’s mental and emotional state. Some of the most powerful users are also the most unstable and volatile.
Some examples of powers and disorders are:
Schizophrenia: Illusion creation, telepathy, mind control
Bipolar disorder: Emotion manipulation, energy manipulation, super speed
OCD: Order manipulation, pattern manipulation, probability manipulation
PTSD: Memory manipulation, fear manipulation, time manipulation
ADHD: Hyperfocus, enhanced senses, multitasking
Autism: Enhanced intelligence, logic manipulation, sensory manipulation
Depression: Pain manipulation, gravity manipulation, darkness manipulation
Anxiety: Precognition, danger sense, teleportation

In this world, there is also a dominant religion that worships a divine being called the Creator. The Creator is believed to be the source of all order and harmony in the world, and the one who gave humans free will and reason. The followers of this religion are called the "Faithful", and they adhere to a strict set of rules and rituals that are meant to please the Creator and maintain his favor.

The Faithful view the Afflicted as abominations and heretics. They believe that they are possessed by devils that corrupted their minds and souls, and that they are the cause of all chaos and suffering in the world. They also believe that they are a threat to the Creator's plan and will, and that they must be either converted or eliminated.

The power system of the Faithful is based on faith and devotion. They have a hierarchy of priests and clerics that can perform miracles and blessings by invoking the Creator's name and will. They also have a network of agents and spies that can detect and track down the Afflicted by using holy relics and symbols. They also have a militia of warriors and crusaders that can fight and capture the Afflicted by using holy weapons and armor.

The Faithful use their power system to oppress and persecute the Afflicted. They use propaganda and indoctrination to spread their beliefs and values to the masses. They use intimidation and coercion to force the Afflicted to renounce their abilities and join their faith. They use torture and execution to punish the Afflicted who resist or rebel. They use crusades and wars to eradicate the Afflicted who form their own groups or communities.

However, what the Faithful do not realize is that they have a mental illness that is called "Delusional Disorder". This disorder makes them believe in things that are not true or supported by evidence, such as the existence of the Creator and his plan. They also have a strong need to conform to a group and follow a leader, which makes them susceptible to indoctrination and manipulation by the priests and clerics.

The Faithful's powers or miracles are actually manifestations of their delusions. They use their faith and devotion as a way to cope with their disorder and to have hope in a chaotic and cruel world. However, their faith also makes them blind to reality and intolerant of others who do not share their beliefs. They project their own fears and insecurities onto the Afflicted, whom they see as devils and enemies.

The Faithful's powers or miracles are based on the concept of "Placebo Effect". This effect is when a person's belief or expectation influences their physical or mental state, such as when a sugar pill can relieve pain or when a fake surgery can improve health. The Faithful's belief in the Creator and his will makes them experience positive effects when they perform rituals or invoke his name, such as healing wounds, enhancing strength, or creating light. However, these effects are only temporary and depend on their level of faith and devotion. If they doubt or lose their faith, their powers or miracles will fade or fail.



WORLD MAP

The world is divided into two major continents: the Western Continent and the Eastern Continent. Each continent has its own history, culture, and politics, and they are often in conflict or competition with each other.

The Western Continent is dominated by the Holy Kingdom of Verona, a powerful and prosperous nation that follows the religion of the Creator. The Veronans have a strong sense of order and hierarchy, and they value loyalty, honor, and duty. They have a large and well-trained army that protects their borders and expands their territory. They also have a sophisticated and elegant society that enjoys art, music, and literature.

The Veronans are the main enemies of the Afflicted, whom they consider to be devils and heretics. They have a special branch of priests and clerics called the Inquisition, who are tasked with hunting down and eliminating the Afflicted. They also have a secret organization called the Order of the Cross, who are fanatical zealots that perform assassinations and sabotage against the Afflicted.

The Western Continent also has three other major cities that are independent from Verona. They are:

Lutetia: A city of commerce and culture that is located on the coast. It is famous for its trade, tourism, and entertainment. It is also known for its tolerance and diversity, as it welcomes people from different backgrounds and beliefs. Many Afflicted find refuge in Lutetia, where they can live in relative peace and anonymity.
Avalon: A city of arcane arts and mystery that is hidden in a forest. It is home to many alchemists, and scholars who study the arcane arts. It is also a sanctuary for many mythical creatures and beings who are endangered or persecuted by Verona. Avalon has a secretive and mysterious nature, as it only reveals itself to those who are worthy or invited.
Babylon: A city of sin and decadence that is located in a desert. It is infamous for its crime, corruption, and vice. It is also a haven for many outlaws, rebels, and renegades who oppose Verona. Babylon has a chaotic and anarchic nature, as it follows no rules or laws except its own.
The Western Continent also has a large area of land that is unexplored and unknown. It is called the Forbidden Land by all who live there, as it is said to be full of dangers and mysteries. Even the Veronans dare not venture into it, as they fear what lies within. Some rumors say that it is a cursed land where ancient evils dwell. Others say that it is a hidden land where ancient secrets lie.

The Eastern Continent is composed of four different countries that have their own cultures and identities. They are:

The Ravdtorn Empire: A militaristic and imperialistic nation that is inspired by Japanese culture in real life. The Ravdtorns have a strong sense of honor and pride, and they value courage, discipline, and skill. They have a formidable and ruthless army that conquers and subjugates other lands.

The Maharlikans have a strong sense of adventure and exploration, and they value freedom, diversity, and commerce. They have a vibrant and colorful society that thrives on trade, tourism, and entertainment. They also have a vast and powerful navy that dominates the seas and connects them to other lands.

Races

Along with humans in this world, there are other races that have their own origins, cultures, and abilities. They are:

The Spirits: Also known as the manifestations of nature. The Spirits are ethereal and elemental beings that embody the forces and aspects of nature, such as the sky, the land, the water, and the underground. They do not have territories or civilizations, but they do have a realm of their own that is separate from the physical world. They are called the Spirit Realm, and it is a place of wonder and mystery. The Spirits are deeply connected to the Luhndreis, who share their respect and harmony for nature. The Spirits often aid or guide the Luhndreis in their quests and endeavors, or sometimes join them as companions or bondmates. The Spirits have various abilities that reflect their nature, such as controlling the weather, shaping the terrain, creating illusions, or granting blessings.


The Erudites: Also known as the Philosophers of the Deep. The Erudites are a race of seafolks that are renowned for their intelligence and knowledge. They have a body similar to that of humans, but with large vertical obloid heads that house their enormous brains. They also have gills, fins, and scales that allow them to live and breathe underwater. They are a very secluded race, as they prefer to dwell in the depths of the ocean, where they study and experiment with various subjects and phenomena. They do not care much for interacting with others who are not on the same wavelength as theirs, and they often regard them as inferior or ignorant. The Erudites have various abilities that reflect their intellect, such as telepathy, telekinesis, mind control, or logic manipulation.


The Utopians: Also known as the Visitors from the Dreaming. The Utopians are a race from the World of Dreams, a dimension that is parallel to the physical world. They are peaceful and curious fellas with mystical looks. Some say they are the epitome of beauties. They have slender and graceful bodies, fair and smooth skin, long and silky hair, and bright and expressive eyes. They also have unique features that vary from individual to individual, such as horns, wings, tails, or ears. They are very rarely sighted in the physical world, as they only visit it when they are asleep or when they are summoned by someone who has a strong connection to the World of Dreams. The Utopians have various abilities that reflect their dreams, such as creating or entering dreams, manipulating dreams, or granting wishes.

Currency


Oriental Maharlika uses a commodity-backed money system that is based on pearls. Pearls are a natural resource that are abundant and valuable in the region, and have been used as a medium of exchange for centuries. Pearls are also a symbol of the nation's identity and culture, as they are featured on the flag and coat of arms.

The currency unit of Oriental Maharlika is called the perla, which is equivalent to one gram of pure pearl. The perla is divided into 100 centavos, which are smaller units of pearl. The government issues paper notes and metal coins that represent different denominations of perlas and centavos, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 perlas, and 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos. These notes and coins are legal tender and can be used to pay for goods and services within the country.

However, unlike fiat money, the notes and coins are not worthless in themselves. They are backed by a fixed amount of pearls that are stored in the central bank and other authorized institutions. The government guarantees that anyone can exchange their notes and coins for pearls at any time, at a fixed rate of one perla per gram of pearl. This ensures that the currency maintains its value and stability, as it is not affected by inflation or deflation.

The government also regulates the supply and demand of pearls in the market, by buying and selling pearls from domestic and foreign sources. The government aims to maintain a balance between the amount of pearls in circulation and the amount of pearls in reserve, to avoid shortages or surpluses that could affect the currency's value. The government also monitors the quality and purity of pearls in the market, to ensure that they meet the standards for currency conversion.

The pearl-backed currency system has some advantages and disadvantages for Oriental Maharlika. Some of the advantages are:

- It preserves the nation's tradition and heritage of using pearls as money.
- It provides a stable and reliable currency that is not subject to inflation or deflation.
- It encourages saving and investment, as people can store their wealth in pearls that do not lose value over time.
- It promotes trade and tourism, as pearls are widely accepted and valued by other countries.

Some of the disadvantages are:

- It limits the flexibility and responsiveness of monetary policy, as the government cannot adjust the money supply according to changing economic conditions.
- It exposes the currency to external shocks and fluctuations, as the price and availability of pearls depend on factors beyond the government's control.
- It creates a dependency on pearls as a source of income and wealth, which could be unsustainable or harmful for the environment.
- It requires a high level of security and transparency, as the government has to protect its pearl reserves from theft or fraud.
